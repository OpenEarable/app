# Hamster Hurdle


## About
This application is an endless runner game. By clicking on Start a game is loaded, where a hamster
is running through a tunnel. By making a small jump (in other words by quickly moving the 
earable upwards) the player can jump over obstacles that are randomly generated and appear on 
screen. To make the hamster duck the player has to do a squat (move the earable down). To get out
of the ducking position the player has to move upwards again. When the hamster collides with an 
object the game ends. Throughout the game a score is calculated based on how long the game is 
going on.


## Tests
I have a windows PC. Because of the Gradle error i was unable to test my App in the Android Emulator 
or on a physical Android Phone. That's why Hamster Hurdle was only tested on Chrome(Web) 
and Edge(Web). Please keep this in mind when testing the app.
